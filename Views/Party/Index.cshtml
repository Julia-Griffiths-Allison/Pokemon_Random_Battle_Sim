                I would suggest opening this image in another tab.

            You will read this table by locating the <strong>attacking</strong> pokemon's type on the <strong>left</strong> side,
            <br />
            then the <strong>defending</strong> pokemon's type will be from the <strong>top</strong>.
            <br />
            Where they meet on the table will represent the buff (or debuff) the <strong>attacking pokemon will recieve</strong> upon impact.
            <br />
            <br />
            *************************
            <br />
            <br />
            - 1x attack will be a normal attack, where neither pokemon has the advantage or disadvantage.
            <br />
            - 2x attack will mean the attack pokemon is super effective! Dealing double the normal amount of damage!
            <br />
            - .5x attack will deal only half of the attack power, because the attacker is not very effective...
            <br />
            - 0x attack means you deal no damage! The attacker is completly ineffective against the defending pokemon!
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to this table, there are some pokemon who are <i>duel type</i>.
            <br />
            You may want to Google those specific pokemon and their weakness, but as far as this game is conserned we will only be using the predominent type to attack.
            <br />
            For example, if you have a Charizard (who is fire and flying,) Charizard will only be attacking with a fire move!
            <br />
            But will still take double damage to an electric move!
